After the 3rd day of being off I started with severe sweating, heart palpatations, difficulty breathing, restlessness, just feeling horrible. I never thought of withdrawal at all. After talking my doctor into restarting my medication the symptoms subsided in two days. I learned first hand the danger of stopping this medication suddenly, so my advice is \"don't do it without MD supervision\"!. Great medication for what it is intended for though.",

It allows me to function at a high level while maintaining my stability and I have not been hospitalized since I have been on this medication (2003).  Unfortunately, I was not able to completely stop the zyprexa I had been taking; I still need a small dose of 2.5mg of that as well.  But along with my mood stabilizer (lamictal) and my antidepressant(wellbutrin \nSR), I never dreamed I would be this stable.  I have some side effects, though nothing that bothersome.  I have occasional muscle twitches, which I choose to put up with rather than add yet another medication (like cogentin).  I am almost completely symptom free.  I have read that loxapine is very similar to clozapine, but doesn't cause as much weight gain or blood disorders.  Oh, that's another thing: I have been able to lose over 70 lbs since going on this drug and reducing the zyprexa.  I HIGHLY recommend this drug for schizophrenia or schizoaffective; I'm not sure why it's not prescribed more often.  I suspect it is almost as effective as clozapine.",

Daily with 80 mg. Nortriptyline and 3 lomotil tabs with meals.  Until I went on Medicare, I took 2mg. Lotronex daily with limited additional medications ; however Lotronex 2 x daily is now too expensive. \nWith Lotronex, My quality of life has significantly improved and I seldom have to use tincture of opium.  I hope that the price of Lotronex goes down for  those on medicare.  Anyone with chronic diarrhea should have access to this drug.",

Doctors have been unable to diagnose the cause and have experimented with every type of medicine available.  One week ago I returned to my local eye doctor because the problem had become worse to the point of infection. I had been using Tobradex for some time but it was no longer working.  My doctor gave me a sample of Lotemax and in 3 days my eye  (for the first time in 5 years) cleared up and stopped tearing.  It seems almost too good to be true for me but today is 7 days of no tears.",
